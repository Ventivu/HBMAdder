//以下为原更新日志
1.0.1.10
- api package-info.java cleanup (closes #80)
- now you won't lose items in bauble crafting grid when switching back to vanilla inventory 

1.0.1.9
- Update to Forge 10.13.2+ 
- possible fix for HA dropping near player spawn location instead of at where he died.

1.0.1.8
- change save filenames back to using username instead of UUID to prevent issues in offline mode. 
- saves will break if you change your username, but it is the lesser of two evils imo and easy enough to fix by hand

1.0.1.7
- fix for HA shortcut "ring" suddenly not shifting like it should when potion effects are active

1.0.1.6
- added a secondary client sync event in case a player logs off and then on again before his player gets unloaded from a server.

1.0.1.5
- onUnequip will now only be called once if a bauble is removed via shift-click

1.0.1.4
- detect NEI so HA "ring" button is placed correctly (most of the time).

1.0.1.3
- created workaround for unnecessary calls to onEquipped and onUneEquipped
- fixed a bug where onUneEquipped wasn't being called if you pick an item up from a slot

1.0.1.2
- added a simple way to switch between the normal and HA inventory. Thanks to Vazkii for the idea and permission to port it to base Baubles.
- removed the Miners Ring crafting recipe... it is a bit op. I will leave the item in so it is attainable in creative and so it can still serve as an example bauble for devs.

1.0.1.1
- added backwards compatibility for legacy (pre 1.7.10) savefiles

1.0.1.0
- update for MC 1.7.10
- no requires Forge 10.13.0.1177
- removed support for legacy save format and moved saving/loading to new forge events

1.0.0.16
- switch to SimpleNetworkWrapper
- now requires Forge 10.12.1.1110

1.0.0.15
- hide slot background when drawing slots with items in HA inventory

1.0.0.14
- prevent loss of non-HA items on death

1.0.0.13
- properly clear player HA inventory before he enters the world and reset file pointers
- only attempt to load or save HA server-side

1.0.0.12
- fix for HA being synced to the wrong player on the client

1.0.0.11
- HA are now synced to all clients on a server, allowing modders to add visual components or other client-side stuff for HA.

1.0.0.10
- moved HA data from player data to custom savefiles (*.baub)
- a backup file is also saved each time in case the main one becomes corrupt.
- automatically revert to backup file if main one cannot be loaded. If both cannot be loaded revert to old player data format. This will also insure that data from previous HA versions will be loaded the first time.

1.0.0.9
- undoing the "HA hotkey closes all inventories" change. It was messing with anything that allows text input

1.0.0.8
- sync HA itemstack data between client and server if changed outside the HA GUI

1.0.0.7
- the HA hotkey can now be used to close any gui the player has open
- check for "keepInventory" game rule to prevent HA from dropping on death

1.0.0.6
- additional checks to prevent the wrong items getting into the wrong slots
- minor changes to te example ring so it doesn't get used when you right-click to equip in creative mode

1.0.0.5
- API: added a few new methods. I know there is nothing more annoying than constantly changing api's, but hopefully these kinds of changes will be few and far between.

1.0.0.4
- allow other mods to force a save by marking the inventory as dirty

1.0.0.3
- example ring can now be rightclicked like armor to equip it

1.0.0.2
- HA inventory now opens when it's hotkey is pressed in creative

1.0.0.1
- properly trigger unequip event when shift clicking out of bauble slot
